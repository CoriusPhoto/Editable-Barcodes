# Editable-Barcodes
This script was developped using Adobe Extendscript to allow the automatic creation of barcodes in any Adobe Illustrator document while always keeping them conveniently editable. This is particularly handy when used with datasets.
Currently, the supported barcode formats are EAN13 and ITF14.
